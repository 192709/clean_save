What is this about?

Elevator story:
I save some folders daily to a tar.xz file on min 2 disks.I want to keep that files for  120 days to restore if needed. But I want to thin out the files which are older:
2 years old I keep one per Month
4 to 2 Years one per quater year
4 to 12 one per year-

Written in lovely and easy rust with clap, so clean_save --help is your friend to change folders or file extension or just dryrun.

Feel free to use, but do not expect any guarantee :-)

Enjoy
